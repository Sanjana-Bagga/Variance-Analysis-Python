📊 Region-wise Sales Variance Analysis
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales performance across different regions by comparing actual sales data against budgeted targets.

🔍 Objective:
To identify variances in sales at both monthly and regional levels to uncover performance gaps, highlight overachieving areas, and support data-driven decision-making.

🧮 Key Features:

Variance Calculation:
Calculated absolute variance between budgeted and actual sales on a month-wise and region-wise basis.

Trend & Pattern Analysis:
Highlighted fluctuations in performance using descriptive statistics and trend comparison across different time frames.

Visualization:
Created intuitive and visually appealing charts using Matplotlib to show:

Region-wise sales variances

Monthly performance trends

Underperforming vs overperforming regions

📈 Outcome:
The analysis helped in:

Pinpointing sales shortfalls and exceeding targets

Identifying regions with consistent performance issues

Supporting strategic planning with visual insights
